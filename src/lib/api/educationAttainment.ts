/**
 * PDS education rows → the attainment text succession scores.

 * `employee_education` is the table the Personal Data Sheet edits. The legacy

 * never writes, so succession treated a new Master's as if it did not exist.
 * Reading the rows here keeps the detail table as the source of truth, with the
 * legacy column kept as a fallback for employees whose PDS was never filled in.
 *
 * Two consumers shape the output:
 *   - `educationRank` (successionCriteria.ts) reads degree words —
 *     master / doctorate / bachelor — so the course text matters.
 *   - the education gate tokenises the text to compare fields of study
 *     (succession.ts), so every degree is offered, not just the highest.
