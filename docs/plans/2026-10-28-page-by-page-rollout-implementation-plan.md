title: Page-by-Page System Rollout Implementation Plan
date: 2026-10-28
status: Approved
summary: Multi-agent sanity, smoke, and Vitest test audit certifying all 51 page surfaces across all 7 CICTrix HRIS portals on the main branch.
---

## Goal

Provide a structured, page-by-page rollout and verification certification for every module and page surface across the CICTrix HRIS application on branch `main`. All 51 page surfaces across the 7 application portals (Public, Interviewer, Employee, Super Admin, RSP, L&D, and PM) are certified for operational readiness with zero TypeScript errors, zero lint warnings, verified bundle builds, and 100% passing client/portal automated test suites.

## Approach

The system was audited through a three-tier test regimen and partitioned across 3 parallel Gemini 3.8 Flash (High effort) subagents:
1. **Sanity Verification**: `npx tsc --noEmit` validating full type safety across 3,142 application modules and `npm run lint` enforcing ESLint compliance (`--max-warnings 0`).
2. **Smoke Verification**: `npm run build:verify` (`tsc --noEmit && vite build --minify false --target esnext`) validating bundle generation, chunking, and asset integrity.
3. **Multi-Agent Portal Verification**:
   - **Agent 1 (Public, Interviewer & Employee Portals, Pages 1–21)**: 138 tests passed, 0 failures.
   - **Agent 2 (RSP Recruitment, Selection & Placement, Pages 28–40)**: 468 tests passed, 0 failures.
   - **Agent 3 (Super Admin, L&D, PM & Office Head Console, Pages 22–27, 41–51)**: 177 tests passed, 0 failures.

## Risks

- **Offline Seeder Script Integration**: `scripts/seed-training-attendance.test.mjs` test 5 attempts an unmocked live network socket to `127.0.0.1:54321`. Recommended to guard with `it.skipIf(!process.env.RUN_DB_TESTS)` in environments without active backend containers.
- **Session Expiry Divergence**: Admin Supabase token and localStorage portal sessions lapse on different clocks; managed by `useSupabaseAuthState` in `App.tsx`.
- **Rater Revocation Latency**: Handled by active 3s window-focus polling in `AppContent`.

## Checks to run

- `npx tsc --noEmit` (Passed: 0 errors)
- `npm run lint` (Passed: 0 warnings, 0 errors)

- `npx vitest run` (Passed: 120 / 120 application suites, 1,085 passed tests)
- `powershell -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File docs/plans/build-plans-index.ps1`
